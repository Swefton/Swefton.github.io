## Inspiration

At least two of us weren't registered going into the event so we got up at 8AM to get to Education Sciences, hoping to be one of the first on the waitlist. 

We were not. 

When we did eventually enter, we thought that the check-in system was overloaded (no fault of the organisers!) just because of the sheer number of people who showed up. We thought we could create a more efficient system. In addition, we wanted to create a way to explore local events using the data from the check-in system so that more people could check out what was happening around Madison.
